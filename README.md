# ufo-website
Web application that allows users to search info on UFO sightings. Data was pulled from the National UFO Reporting Center. Written in Python, HTML, and CSS, with PostgreSQL and Flask. This project was created by myself and Dillon Lanier for CS257 (Software Design) in the Spring of 2019.
